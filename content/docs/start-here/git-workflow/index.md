This section gives an overview of the workflow for contributing to the GitHub repository. If you are unfamiliar with basic Git commands such as `git clone`, `git pull`, or `git push`, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/">FreeCodeCamp</a> has a pretty good tutorial on Git and GitHub. You can also refer to the <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">Git Cheatsheet</a> in case you forget any of the commands.

## Creating Branches

You will primarily be developing in your own separate branch other than `main`. This ensures a smooth environment for collaboration and minimization of conflicts.

## Commit Messages

We will be using <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</a> as our commit message style. Make sure to adhere to this guide when authoring commit messages, as it makes going through commit histories much easier.
